## Overview

PURIPURI is an AI-powered adaptive math learning platform that revolutionizes how students learn mathematics through personalized, interactive, and effective learning experiences. By combining AI technology with effective pedagogical approaches, PURi bridges the gap between passive and active learning methodologies to create a comprehensive learning solution.

> "The essence of mathematics is not to make simple things complicated, but to make complicated things simple." - PURIPURI's approach to math education

- **Cloud Synchronization**: Access learning materials across devices
- **Offline Capability**: Continue learning even without internet connection

## Architecture

### System Architecture

PURi implements a three-tier architecture consisting of:

1. **Client Layer**: React-based frontend with tablet-optimized UI
2. **Application Layer**: AI processing, learning management, and content delivery
3. **Data Layer**: Secure storage of learning data, user information, and content

</p>

### AI Architecture

The AI engine consists of three primary components:

1. **OCR Engine**: Digitizes handwritten math solutions with high accuracy
2. **LLM (Generative AI)**: Creates context-aware hints and personalized feedback
3. **Adaptive Learning Algorithm**: Analyzes performance data to tailor learning experiences

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the interactive user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern design
- **Canvas API**: For handwriting capture and processing

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side application logic
- **Express**: API framework
- **MongoDB**: Data storage and management
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: AI model implementation

### AI Components
- **Custom OCR**: Specialized for mathematical notation
- **Transformer-based LLM**: For generating adaptive learning content
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: For analyzing student work and progress

## How It Works

### Learning Flow

1. **Watch Concept Video**: Students begin with instructional video content
2. **Apply Concepts**: Solve math problems using the tablet interface
3. **Receive Guidance**: Get real-time feedback and hints when stuck
4. **Review & Practice**: Revisit challenging concepts with targeted exercises
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor improvement through comprehensive analytics

</p>

### Three Learning Modes

#### 1. Guided Learning
- Teacher-created content with step-by-step guidance
- Conceptual explanation and foundational understanding

#### 2. Adaptive Practice
- Personalized problem sets based on student's current level
- Difficulty adjusts in real-time based on performance

#### 3. Problem-Solving Workshop
- Advanced challenges for deeper mathematical thinking
- AI analyzes solution approaches and provides targeted feedback
