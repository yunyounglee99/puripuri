</p>

### AI Architecture

The AI engine consists of three primary components:

1. **OCR Engine**: Digitizes handwritten math solutions with high accuracy
2. **LLM (Generative AI)**: Creates context-aware hints and personalized feedback
3. **Adaptive Learning Algorithm**: Analyzes performance data to tailor learning experiences

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React**: For building the interactive user interface
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern design
- **Canvas API**: For handwriting capture and processing

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side application logic
- **Express**: API framework
- **MongoDB**: Data storage and management
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: AI model implementation

### AI Components
- **Custom OCR**: Specialized for mathematical notation
- **Transformer-based LLM**: For generating adaptive learning content
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: For analyzing student work and progress

## How It Works

### Learning Flow

1. **Watch Concept Video**: Students begin with instructional video content
2. **Apply Concepts**: Solve math problems using the tablet interface
3. **Receive Guidance**: Get real-time feedback and hints when stuck
4. **Review & Practice**: Revisit challenging concepts with targeted exercises
5. **Track Progress**: Monitor improvement through comprehensive analytics
